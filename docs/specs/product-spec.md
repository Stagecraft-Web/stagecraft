# AI-Orchestrated Static Website Platform for Musicians

## 1. Overview

This document specifies a platform for creating, migrating, editing, previewing, and publishing simple musician websites using an AI coding agent (Claude Code) as the primary implementation engine.

The platform should target non-technical users who currently pay too much for simple brochure-style websites built on site builders such as Squarespace or Wix. The product should allow users to own their website code and hosting setup while making site creation and editing as simple as possible through natural-language requests.

The platform itself should act as an orchestration layer around:

- GitHub repos
- Netlify deployment and deploy previews
- AI-driven code and content changes
- Structured content and asset workflows
- A lightweight backend for contact form delivery

The generated websites should be:

- static-first
- portable
- easy to edit manually
- easy to edit through AI prompting
- strongly constrained by framework, typing, schemas, and tests

The default technical stack for generated websites should be:

- Astro
- React integration enabled
- TypeScript
- Netlify hosting
- repo-owned content and assets
- no CMS database for site content

## 2. Product Vision

The platform should provide musician websites that users fully own, while letting them request changes in plain English.

The key product promise is:

> Own your website outright, keep hosting simple, and request changes in plain English with preview links before anything goes live.

The platform should not primarily be positioned as a generic AI website builder. It should be positioned as an AI site steward for simple musician websites.

## 3. Goals

### 3.1 Primary goals

1. Allow a non-technical musician to create a custom static website with minimal setup friction.
2. Allow a non-technical musician to edit their website through plain-language requests.
3. Ensure every site is fully portable via a normal GitHub repository the user owns.
4. Ensure changes are safe and reviewable through Git branches, pull requests, and Netlify deploy previews.
5. Keep site content database-free and repo-native.
6. Make the generated code maintainable for humans and constrained enough for reliable AI edits.
7. Support migration from existing brochure-style musician sites.

### 3.2 Secondary goals

1. Support image-heavy musician websites with responsive image handling.
2. Support lightweight custom interactivity.
3. Support contact forms without introducing a content database.
4. Allow advanced users to manually edit their own repos outside the platform.

## 4. Non-goals

The initial version should not optimize for:

1. arbitrary business websites
2. ecommerce
3. memberships / user accounts on the generated sites
4. blog/CMS editing through a traditional admin panel
5. multi-user collaborative editing within a site
6. complex server-rendered applications
7. arbitrary plugin ecosystems
8. full visual drag-and-drop site editing
9. heavy custom backend logic per customer site
10. a proprietary content database for customer site content

## 5. Target user

The target user is a non-technical or lightly technical musician with a simple public website. Their site typically contains some combination of:

- home
- about / bio
- music / discography
- videos
- photos / gallery
- press / EPK / resume
- teaching
- tour dates
- contact form

They want:

- a better and cheaper website than a site builder
- a custom look and feel
- ownership of code and hosting
- the ability to request edits in plain language
- the ability to upload images and paste text content
- the ability to approve changes before they go live

## 6. Product principles

1. **Repo is source of truth**
   Customer site content and code should live in the Git repo.

2. **Preview before publish**
   All meaningful changes should go through preview URLs before merge to production.

3. **Constrain the AI**
   The platform should give Claude Code structured tasks, repo conventions, schemas, and limited surface area.

4. **Portability is a feature**
   Customers should always be able to clone their repo and continue without the platform.

5. **Static-first**
   Sites should be generated as static-first brochure sites with optional small interactive islands.

6. **No customer content DB**
   Page content and media metadata should live in the repo instead of a hosted CMS.

7. **Human-auditable changes**
   Every change should correspond to a branch, commit set, PR, and deploy preview where possible.

## 7. High-level architecture

The system consists of two layers:

### 7.1 Platform application

A web app that users interact with. Responsibilities:

- user authentication into the platform
- linking external accounts (GitHub, Netlify)
- onboarding and site creation
- migration flow from an existing site URL
- gathering user content and assets
- collecting edit requests in natural language
- orchestrating Claude Code tasks
- showing PR / preview / status information
- allowing user approval / rejection / revision

### 7.2 Generated customer site repos

Each customer site is a normal GitHub repo that the customer owns or has access to. Responsibilities:

- Astro site code
- content files
- image assets
- tests
- lint / typecheck / build scripts
- deploy configuration

The platform should not make the generated sites dependent on a proprietary runtime.

## 8. External integrations

### 8.1 GitHub

GitHub is required or strongly preferred.

Use GitHub for:

- repo creation
- branching
- pull requests
- commit history
- ownership and portability
- collaboration with technical users

The platform should prefer a GitHub App or OAuth-based integration with appropriate permissions.

### 8.2 Netlify

Netlify should be used for:

- site hosting
- production deploys
- deploy previews for branches / pull requests
- environment variables for contact-form backend

### 8.3 AI provider

The platform should directly call the model provider itself rather than depending on the customer’s own Claude subscription/session.

Rationale:

- simpler UX
- more predictable orchestration
- less fragility
- easier support
- easier observability and retries

### 8.4 Email / contact form delivery

Use Resend plus a serverless endpoint for form submission delivery.

Preferred initial architecture:

- static site frontend
- Netlify Function or equivalent lightweight backend endpoint
- Resend API for email delivery

Do not introduce a submissions database in v1.

## 9. Framework decision

Generated sites should use:

- Astro
- React integration enabled
- TypeScript strict mode

### 9.1 Why Astro

Astro is the best default fit because generated sites are mostly brochure-style, content-heavy, and static-first.

Benefits:

- minimal client-side JS by default
- strong fit for content-centric websites
- support for reusable `.astro` components
- support for React islands where richer interactivity is needed
- excellent fit for repo-owned image and content workflows
- simpler static mental model for AI-generated code

### 9.2 Why enable React by default

Every generated site should initialize with Astro + React + TypeScript even if many sites do not use much React initially.

Benefits:

- one canonical project structure across all sites
- easy support for richer widgets when needed
- consistent AI generation paths
- familiar escape hatch for technical users

### 9.3 Rendering model

Use:

- `.astro` components for most presentational UI
- native Astro `<script>` blocks for lightweight custom JS
- React components only for more complex interactive widgets

## 10. Generated repo requirements

Each customer site repo should follow a standard layout.

Example:

```txt
/
  astro.config.mjs
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
  netlify.toml
  README.md
  CLAUDE.md
  EDITING.md
  /src
    /components
    /layouts
    /pages
    /assets
    /lib
    /styles
    /content
  /public
    /favicons
    /downloads
  /tests
  /.github
    /workflows
```

### 10.1 Repo conventions

1. `src/components/` contains reusable presentational and interactive components.
2. `src/layouts/` contains site shells and shared layouts.
3. `src/pages/` contains route files.
4. `src/assets/` contains source images that should be optimized.
5. `public/` should only contain assets that should be copied as-is, such as favicons, robots.txt, or downloadable PDFs.
6. `src/lib/` contains helper utilities.
7. `tests/` contains smoke/integration tests.
8. `CLAUDE.md` contains agent-specific instructions for editing within the repo.
9. `EDITING.md` contains user-facing explanations of repo structure and common manual edits.

## 11. Content model

The site content should be structured and repo-native.

The platform must not treat arbitrary component code as the primary content-editing surface.

### 11.1 Content storage principles

Store content in typed, structured files such as:

- JSON
- YAML
- Markdown / MDX
- Astro content collections if useful

### 11.2 Recommended content structure

Example:

```txt
/src/content
  /config
    site.json
    nav.json
    theme.json
  /pages
    home.md
    about.md
    music.md
    press.md
    contact.md
  /collections
    photos/
    releases/
    videos/
    pressQuotes/
    tourDates/
```

### 11.3 Content-editing principle

Most user requests should map to structured content edits first.

Examples:

- “Update my bio” should primarily edit `about.md`
- “Add these 5 photos” should primarily add assets plus metadata entries
- “Add a Teaching page” should add a page content file and register it in navigation config
- “Change my homepage button text” should edit structured homepage content

The AI should only edit layout/component code when the request truly implies a design or structural change.

## 12. Asset and image handling

### 12.1 Asset storage strategy

Store source image assets in the repo under `src/assets/` or equivalent.

Do not place user-uploaded source images in `public/` if they should participate in optimization.

### 12.2 Responsive image strategy

For each source image:

1. store the original normalized asset in the repo
2. generate multiple responsive sizes at build time
3. render with `srcset` / `sizes`
4. use `<picture>` for mobile/desktop art direction when needed

### 12.3 Default generated variants

Suggested standard sizes:

- 640w
- 960w
- 1280w
- 1600w
- 2400w for large hero use cases only

### 12.4 Asset metadata

Each significant image should have metadata such as:

- alt text
- usage slot / page section
- crop/focal information if available
- optional mobile-specific variant

Example:

```json
{
  "alt": "Portrait of the artist performing live",
  "image": "photos/hero-desktop.jpg",
  "mobileImage": "photos/hero-mobile.jpg"
}
```

### 12.5 Asset upload rules

The platform should:

- normalize filenames
- constrain image file size and dimensions
- optionally compress / transcode on upload
- reject extremely large source files
- preserve good portability and repo hygiene

### 12.6 Asset portability

All site-critical images should remain repo-owned so that users can clone the repo and retain their assets.

## 13. Interactivity and custom JS

### 13.1 Default approach

Generated sites should remain mostly static.

### 13.2 Allowed interactivity types

Support lightweight custom interactions such as:

- mobile nav toggles
- image lightboxes
- slideshows / carousels
- audio player widgets
- embedded media interactions
- simple animated homepage elements
- enhanced form feedback states

### 13.3 Implementation hierarchy

Use the least complex tool that satisfies the request:

1. static `.astro` component
2. `.astro` component with small `<script>` block
3. React component hydrated as an island

### 13.4 Constraint

Avoid turning the site into a client-heavy SPA unless the user has a very strong reason.

## 14. Site templates / blueprints

The platform should start with a small number of constrained site blueprints.

Suggested initial blueprints:

1. Solo artist
2. Band / ensemble
3. Composer / educator
4. Artist with press kit / EPK emphasis
5. Tour-focused artist

Each blueprint should define:

- page types
- section inventory
- design token structure
- navigation rules
- image slot definitions
- optional interactive widgets
- content schema

The AI should generate within a blueprint rather than inventing an unconstrained site structure from scratch.

## 15. User workflows

### 15.1 New site creation

1. User signs into the platform.
2. User links GitHub and Netlify.
3. User chooses a site blueprint.
4. User provides key content:
   - artist name
   - short bio
   - pages desired
   - social/profile links
   - music/video embeds
   - image assets
5. Platform creates repo and baseline project.
6. AI fills content and styles within constraints.
7. Initial preview is generated.
8. User requests revisions.
9. User approves and publishes.

### 15.2 Migration from an existing site

1. User enters current site URL.
2. Platform crawls and extracts:
   - routes/pages
   - text content
   - media references
   - embeds
   - navigation
3. Platform maps extracted content into a chosen blueprint.
4. AI generates a migrated site repo.
5. Platform creates preview.
6. User reviews and requests fixes.
7. User approves production launch.

### 15.3 Edit request workflow

1. User enters a plain-language request.
2. Platform classifies the request into one or more categories:
   - content edit
   - asset update
   - page add/remove
   - style update
   - interactive feature
   - repair/fix
3. Platform creates a working branch.
4. AI makes the requested changes.
5. Platform runs validations.
6. If checks pass, open PR and surface preview link.
7. User can:
   - approve
   - ask for revision
   - discard
8. If approved, merge to main and deploy production.

## 16. AI orchestration requirements

Claude Code should not be treated as a freeform autonomous designer. It should be guided by structured tasks and repo conventions.

### 16.1 AI task types

Define separate modes:

1. content edit mode
2. asset update mode
3. new page mode
4. navigation change mode
5. style/theme adjustment mode
6. interactivity/widget mode
7. migration/import mode
8. repair/debug mode

### 16.2 AI execution constraints

Claude Code should:

- prefer editing content files over component code
- preserve template architecture unless a structural change is requested
- avoid broad refactors unless necessary
- produce small, reviewable diffs
- follow existing repo conventions
- keep accessibility high
- keep performance good
- maintain type safety

### 16.3 AI output requirements

Each change operation should produce:

- git branch
- commit(s)
- machine-readable status
- human-readable summary of changes
- list of files changed
- test/build status
- preview URL when available

### 16.4 Human-readable summary example

Summaries shown to users should look like:

- Updated homepage headline and intro text
- Added 4 gallery images to the Photos page
- Created a new Teaching page and added it to navigation
- Changed button styles and heading typography site-wide

## 17. Review and publishing model

### 17.1 Safety model

All significant changes should go through a reviewable preview flow.

### 17.2 Branch / PR model

Each change request should:

1. create a branch
2. commit the generated changes
3. open a PR
4. attach validation status and preview URL

### 17.3 Preview model

Netlify deploy previews should be surfaced prominently in the platform UI.

The user should be able to:

- open preview
- compare with current production site
- review plain-language change summary
- approve or reject

### 17.4 Publish model

Once approved, merge to main and trigger production deployment.

## 18. Validation and testing requirements

The generated repos must be strongly constrained.

### 18.1 Required checks

Every repo should include scripts and CI for:

- `typecheck`
- `lint`
- `build`
- content schema validation
- asset existence validation
- link validation where practical
- smoke tests

### 18.2 Testing philosophy

Optimize for reliability rather than maximum test count.

The most valuable test/validation layers are:

1. schema validation
2. static build validation
3. TypeScript strictness
4. small Playwright smoke suite
5. selective visual checks later

### 18.3 Smoke test examples

At minimum:

- homepage loads
- primary nav works
- key pages return success
- major images render
- contact form UI appears and submits client-side correctly

### 18.4 Accessibility requirements

Generated sites should be accessible by default.

At minimum:

- semantic headings
- alt text requirements for key images
- color contrast checks in design tokens
- keyboard-navigable menus/dialogs
- labeled form inputs
- reduced-motion respect where animation exists

## 19. Error handling requirements

The platform must treat failure handling as a first-class product feature.

### 19.1 Failure categories

Handle at least:

1. AI generated an unwanted direction
2. build failed
3. preview deploy failed
4. content schema invalid
5. missing/invalid asset
6. user changed mind mid-request
7. user wants to revert
8. GitHub/Netlify auth issues

### 19.2 Required responses

For each failure, surface:

- plain-language explanation
- likely cause
- safe next actions
- option to retry, revise, or discard

### 19.3 Example: build failure UX

Instead of showing raw logs only, summarize:

- A newly added image file could not be found
- A page config entry is missing a required title
- A React component was added without the expected props

Then offer:

- auto-fix
- revert last change
- open technical details

### 19.4 Example: AI drift UX

If the user says “I don’t like where this is going,” allow:

- discard branch
- return to last approved state
- retry with stricter constraints such as:
  - keep layout, only edit copy
  - keep colors and fonts
  - do not change navigation

## 20. Manual-editing guarantee

This is a critical product promise.

Users must always be able to:

- clone the repo
- install dependencies
- run locally
- make manual edits
- commit/push outside the platform
- continue using Netlify independently if they choose

Every repo should therefore include:

- clear README
- clear setup instructions
- explanation of content structure
- explanation of image handling
- explanation of deployment flow

## 21. Contact form design

### 21.1 Requirements

Each site may include a contact form.

The contact form should:

- work on a static site
- send email to the artist or designated inbox
- avoid storing content in a site-specific database
- be simple to configure

### 21.2 Architecture

Preferred initial architecture:

- frontend form on the Astro site
- Netlify Function endpoint
- Resend API call from the function
- recipient configured via environment variable or structured site config

### 21.3 Spam considerations

v1 should include lightweight anti-spam measures such as:

- honeypot field
- rate limiting if feasible at the platform or function layer
- optional Turnstile/reCAPTCHA later if needed

## 22. Platform persistence and internal backend

The customer site content should be repo-native, but the platform itself will still require persistence.

The platform backend likely needs to store:

- user account records
- linked integration metadata
- site records
- repo identifiers
- job execution history
- PR/preview status records
- billing records

This persistence should remain separate from customer site content.

## 23. Security and permissions

### 23.1 Principle of least privilege

External integrations should request the minimum required permissions.

### 23.2 Secrets handling

Store secrets such as:

- GitHub app credentials
- Netlify tokens if applicable
- Resend API keys
- environment variables for generated sites

securely in the platform backend and/or Netlify env config.

Do not commit secrets to customer repos.

### 23.3 User ownership

The user should own the repo and the production deploy target whenever possible.

## 24. Design system and styling

Generated websites should use a constrained design system rather than arbitrary one-off styling.

### 24.1 Design token requirements

Each site should define:

- colors
- typography scale
- spacing scale
- border radius
- shadow usage
- button styles
- content width rules

### 24.2 Styling goals

- attractive default modern design
- clear hierarchy for media-heavy artist sites
- accessible contrast
- consistent responsive behavior

## 25. Initial implementation phases

### Phase 1: Core scaffolding and preview loop

Build:

- platform auth
- GitHub linking
- Netlify linking
- repo generator for Astro + React + TypeScript starter
- one or two musician templates
- structured content model
- image upload into repo assets
- AI edit request -> branch -> PR -> preview flow
- build/typecheck/lint/smoke validation

### Phase 2: Migration and richer content workflows

Build:

- existing-site import flow
- page extraction and mapping
- richer photo gallery flows
- page add/remove workflows
- better change summaries
- better error/failure UX

### Phase 3: polish and advanced capabilities

Build:

- optional visual diffing
- more template families
- richer theme controls
- limited advanced widget library
- improved spam protection
- domain/DNS assistance

## 26. Suggested implementation decisions for Claude Code

Claude Code should assume the following defaults unless explicitly changed:

1. framework: Astro + React + TypeScript
2. hosting: Netlify
3. content source of truth: repo files
4. images: stored in `src/assets/`, optimized responsively at build time
5. interactivity: Astro-first, React islands only where justified
6. review model: branch + PR + deploy preview
7. contact form: Netlify Function + Resend
8. tests: lint + typecheck + build + smoke tests
9. portability: always preserved

## 27. Explicit implementation rules for generated sites

1. Prefer `.astro` components over React unless stateful interactivity is needed.
2. Prefer structured content edits over JSX/component edits.
3. Keep diff surface area as small as possible.
4. Keep all site-critical content and assets in the repo.
5. Do not require a database for the site itself.
6. Make the site run locally with a normal install/dev flow.
7. Do not introduce framework complexity unless justified.
8. Keep the architecture understandable by a competent frontend engineer.
9. Preserve accessibility, performance, and portability in every change.
10. Make it easy for future AI edits by keeping code organized and explicit.

## 28. Open questions / future decisions

These are not blockers for initial implementation, but should be resolved during development:

1. Should the platform use GitHub App permissions or OAuth plus repo access?
2. Should customer repos live in customer-owned accounts only, or can some be bootstrapped under a platform org and transferred?
3. What is the exact migration quality bar for importing existing sites?
4. How should tour dates be modeled if customers want frequent updates?
5. Should downloadable assets such as PDFs/EPKs live in `public/` by default?
6. What level of visual theme customization should be exposed directly in the platform UI?
7. Should the platform support DNS/domain setup guidance in v1 or leave that manual?
8. What is the pricing and billing model for AI usage and hosting orchestration?

## 29. Immediate next step for Claude Code

Claude Code should begin by implementing a minimal but production-shaped v1 foundation with the following sequence:

1. create the platform architecture skeleton
2. implement GitHub and Netlify integration scaffolding
3. implement a canonical Astro + React + TypeScript musician-site starter template
4. implement structured content and asset conventions
5. implement image upload and repo asset placement
6. implement AI request -> branch -> change -> validate -> PR -> preview flow
7. implement clear status/error reporting
8. implement one polished end-to-end happy path for creating and editing a musician site

## 30. Summary

Build a platform that orchestrates AI-driven creation and maintenance of simple musician websites, while keeping the websites themselves static-first, repo-owned, preview-driven, portable, and easy to edit both manually and through natural language. The platform is an orchestration layer around GitHub, Netlify, structured repo content, and AI coding workflows—not a proprietary site runtime or CMS.
